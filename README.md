# Sales Insights Project


## Problem Statement:

- AtliQ Hardware, a company specializing in supplying computer hardware and peripherals, is facing significant challenges in managing and understanding its sales data. The company's Sales Director, Bhavin Patel, is struggling to gain accurate insights into sales performance across various regions in India. The existing process involves verbal reports from regional managers, which are often incomplete or overly optimistic, leading to a lack of clear, actionable data.

- Additionally, the Sales Director is overwhelmed with large volumes of Excel files containing raw sales data, making it difficult to extract meaningful insights. The need for a more streamlined, visual approach to data analysis has become apparent. Bhavin Patel requires a system that provides clear, accurate, and easily digestible sales insights to make informed, data-driven decisions and improve sales performance across the company.

- The proposed solution involves developing a Power BI dashboard that consolidates sales data and presents it in a visual format, allowing Bhavin Patel to track key metrics such as revenue, sales trends, and regional performance. This dashboard will enable more effective decision-making and help address the challenges posed by the dynamic and growing market.
